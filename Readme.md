# Concept

Remove grey background from scanned document (jpeg to pdf).

# Intro

Do you know the feel? You have a scanned document at hand and it has a grey background. 
If you print this now it will look like somebody scanned paper and printed it afterwards.


Here is a nodejs script that claude ai spit out, just the kind of thing it is good with. 

# Usage

```shell
npm install
npm main.js path/to/jpeg-file
```

Output file is `path/to/jpeg-file_processed.pdf`
